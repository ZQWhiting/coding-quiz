## Usage

A timer will start counting down in the top right corner of the page, and questions will be rotated into the display with their four corresponding answer options each time an answer button is pressed, until there are no more questions or the timer runs out. Each answer answered incorrectly will penalize the user's remaining time to answer questions and lower their score. The user will then be asked to input their initials to save their score to the high score page.
